      "anything of her life could have come up with something like this in days.  \n",
      " \n",
      "But Draco continues before she can try to form her thoughts into coherent sentences. “I have \n",
      "something else, as well,” he says. Sounding a little more unsure, now. “Far less grand, and it’s \n",
      "really not a finished item at all, but still something.” \n",

      "Properly shocked into speechlessness, Hermione watches as Draco pulls over the thick stack of \n",

      " \n",
      "“It’s slow progress,” he repeats. “But I and several others have been working on the situation in \n",
      "Britain for years now. Judging pureblood alliances and mapping the hereditary order of \n",
      "Wizengamot seats. Identifying candidates for Minister, for a Minister’s cabinet, for Department \n",
      "Heads, and so on. Working on overhauling the Ministry, essentially.”  \n",

      "There’s little Hermione can do but stare.  \n",
      " \n",
      "“It was always meant to be just the nonsensical, political part of you and your colleagues’ work. \n",
      "We’ve been collecting all of your proposals, and their proposals, and compiling them into records \n",
      "and legal documents for our reference. Using the ideals and strategies you’ve drawn up to cross-\n",
      "check and interview candidates, and such. It’s less about creating a vision for wizarding Britain, \n",
      "and more about finding the political mobility to secure that vision.”  \n",
      " \n",
      "He rifles through the stack and then sets it back down on the coffee table. “You’re under no \n",
      "obligation to ever read any of that,” he says. “Whatever you want to know, I can explain. And all \n",
      "this work is still incredibly preliminary. Even with good alternate candidates, the coup required to \n",
      "overthrow the entire Ministry, to accuse and take into custody all the blood supremacists— it’s \n",
      "astronomical. But this work needs to be done, and I thought that perhaps someone else who knew \n",
      "it better could help out.”  \n",

      "His shoulders rise and fall helplessly as he looks up at her for the first time since starting his \n",
      "explanation. “I know you want to go back to London, someday,” he says. “This— hopefully, this \n",
      "would help make that happen.” Another pause, and then— “Please, stop crying,” he says. Voice \n",
      "breaking as he reaches out to take her hand. “Did I upset you? Should we not have done— ” \n",

      "She’s shaking her head. “No,” she whispers. “Draco, this is— truly, this is incredible. I never knew \n",
      "that all this time, all that paperwork— has it been about this?” \n",
      " \n",
      "His fingers squeeze hers. “Usually,” he says. “We had a couple candidates for Minister I wanted to \n",
      "speak to before the holidays.” His eyes are bright as he looks at her. “I just feel— ” He stops, \n",
      "pauses, restarts. “There’s a lot I owe to you, too many things to make up for. This is just a starting \n",
      "point.”  \n",
      " \n",
      "She nods. She’s not sure how to even begin to introduce her gift, now, but it feels unbelievably \n",
      "important that she does. With a wave of her hand the small golden boxes shoot out of her room to \n",
      "where they’re sitting.  \n",
      " \n",
      "“Thank you,” she says. Those two words seem like a decent start. “I can’t wait to read all of your \n",
      "notes. After the holidays are done.” She takes the two boxes and gives one to him, keeping one for \n",
      "herself. “My gift— it’s important that you understand what this means. You know a lot about \n",

      " \n",
      "She pulls open the ribbon holding her box together and is grateful when Draco mimics her \n",
      "actions without question. When both boxes are open she watches as Draco holds back a sharp \n",
      "intake of breath.  \n",
      " \n",
      "“I found the wedding ring on my pillow when I moved in,” she says. “I know this isn’t quite the \n",
      "same ring, because my old one is still at our flat, warded up, but it wasn’t hard to explain to the \n",
      "jeweler what it looked like.” \n",
      " \n",
      "She turns the box in her own hand to face him. “But the point of the gift isn’t really remaking my \n",
      "ring,” she says. “In Muggle weddings, it’s customary for both husband and wife to receive rings.” \n",
      "She shrugs. “I just thought— ” she reaches for the flat, golden band inside her box “ —even though \n",
      "our marriage is a little out of the ordinary, that I ought to show you how intent I am on staying.” \n",
      " \n",
      "His fingers pull her band out of the box and she can see them shaking. “Will you put mine on \n",
      "first?” Hermione asks. Suddenly turning shy.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Draco reaches for her hand and flattens her fingers in his palm, running his thumb along the \n",
      "ridges of her knuckles. Pausing to collect what looks like a thunderstorm of emotions crossing \n",
      "his face. “Thank you for staying,” he says, quietly. The ring slips on easily, and it’s her turn to reach \n",
      "for his hand.  \n",
      " \n",

      "silence after their words carry around the room, as though exchanging overdue gratitude might \n",
      "be something along the lines of exuberant wedding vows.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Then, she leans back against the couch, setting aside the small gift box in her lap to return her \n",
      "attention to the kittens in front of her. “Our first Christmas together,” she says, taking his hand \n",
      "into hers. Deciding to take a risk, and to press a soft kiss against his jaw. His lips chase her \n",
      "forehead as she retreats, one hand rising to cup her jaw tenderly as he leans down. A smile breaks \n",
      "across her face, and for the first time, she watches a similar one lifts the corners of Draco’s lips \n",
      "all the way to crinkle the corners of his eyes.  \n",
      " \n",
      "“You’ve set the bar for gift-giving pretty high, you know?” she teases. Looking down at the cats \n",
      "curled in their laps, and finding not an ounce of urgency inside her to let Harry know they’ll be late \n",
      "for lunch. “This is quite the present.” \n",
